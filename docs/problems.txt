1. We're not really making best use of Redis.
		Redis can perform many data structure type operations directly on values, yet our code is
		written mostly in a traditional ORM fashion: We retrieve data, operate on it, then save it.
		Once we really start making use of Redis we can skip the first step (unless the user actually
		wants to retrieve the data), and perform the last two as a single atomic operation.
		
		1.1. When Change fields we could save the changes immediately, rather than waiting for a save? That could be annoying, though. As many operations are supposed to be Atomic.

2. Dirty tracking, only update modified fields.
3. Validation
4. Atomic Operations and Transactions:
