h2. DONE 

1. Dirty tracking, only update modified fields.
2. More powerful defaults, we should accept a proc/lambda
3. If no key field is specific automagically create one called 'id' that gets a 128 bit UUID.
4. When the key field is changed we should also send a RENAME command (requires Dirty tracking)
5. Validation
6. Errors
