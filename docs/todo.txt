h2. TODO

13. Rename the project
14. Tasks, Generators, and connection handling for Rails 3. http://railsdispatch.com/posts/how-rails-3-enables-more-choices-part-1
15. Migrations. Just because we are schemaless on the DB side doesn't mean evolving data needs won't affect us. Create a Schema model, each element should have one.
		We store at least:
			In %element_class_name%::schema::%guid% (SORTED SET)	=>
				ZADD element_class_name::schema %timestamp% "%guid%"
				ZADD element_class_name::schema %timestamp% "%guid%"
				ZADD element_class_name::schema %timestamp% "%guid%"
				ZADD element_class_name::schema %timestamp% "%guid%"

  In %element_class_name%::schema::%guid%	{id: %guid%, timestamp:%timestamp%, title:%title%, description:%description%}

	e.g. Company.schema.first => {id: %guid%, timestamp:%timestamp%, title:%title%, description:%description%, up:%up%, down:%down%}
			 Company.schema.automigrate
   		 Company.schema.migrate_to(%guid%)
   		 Company.schema.difference(%guid1%, %guid2%)

		Then rake scripts to do common migration tasks and a dsl to write the actual migrations. Add "schema" as a restricted Attribute name.
17. Indices: sorted sets of ids?
	17.1. All Elements: %model_name%::indices::all => %model_keys% so product::indices::all => set of product_keys;
	17.2. Marking attributes as indices: attribute :name, String, :index => true, or attribute :name, String, :index => :unique. both would use the form: %model_name%::indices::%index_name%::%index_values% => %set of model keys%.
	17.3. key indices (for relationships)
	17.4. Number indices. %model_name%::indices::%index_name%::%index_values (integers or floats)% => %set of model keys%.
	17.5. Date/Time indices, cast of unix timestamps when saving %model_name%::indices::%index_name%::%index_values (unix timestamps)% => %set of model keys%.
18. Retrieve random element: using http://code.google.com/p/redis/wiki/SrandmemberCommand
19. Relationships. Create a relationship model that includes Element, it can have properties but no relationships. mate /Users/rollyfordham/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.2-head/gems/rgl-0.4.0/
20. Search through Sphinx/Xapian/Solr: handy full-text node search. http://xapian.org/features. Xapian supports indexing PDFs, Word docs, etc. Need to provide a way to easily dynamicise what gets indexed and how.

21. auto-populated created_at and updated_at.
22. creation of groups based on the union of other networks, can use pub/sub to get notification of when the inner groups change then recalculate the outer group.
23. after update hooks should be passed the fields that have been updated and the original values.
24. Observer classes
25. Can we defined types on non-predefined?
26. after filters (and before?) using pub/sub?

h2. DONE 

1. Dirty tracking, only update modified fields.
2. More powerful defaults, we should accept a proc/lambda
3. If no key field is specific automagically create one called 'id' that gets a 128 bit UUID.
4. When the key field is changed we should also send a RENAME command (requires Dirty tracking)
5. Validation
6. Errors
7. ActiveModel support
8. Ruby 1.9.2 support (well my tests pass anyways)
9.  DONE Create an Element object, it's the common functionality that both Node and Edge require.
11. DONE The hash properties are never saved a property as a time, the entire hash is saved as once. All other properties can be modified using atomic operations. 
					I should split the dsl into hash properties and non-hash properties. Hash properties use the normal modify and bulk save workflow as Datamapper. Non-hash properties
					allow operations to be performed and serialised immediately.
12. DONE We need to allow dynamic hash fields, i.e. ones that were not predefined using the property method. The use cases for both are:
		* Predefined: expected fields, can defined validation/etc
		* Non-predefined: unexpected fields. Dynamically created.
16. Some way for plugins to register registered attribute names: schema, ??

h2. Possible Names
* Snowflake
* Snowfall
